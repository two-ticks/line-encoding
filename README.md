# Line Encoding 

```
Line coding is the process of converting digital data
to digital signals. Line coding converts a sequence of
bits to a digital signal. At the sender, digital data are
encoded into a digital signal; at the receiver, the
digital data are recreated by decoding the digital
signal.

# Line Coding Requirements

* Small transmission bandwidth
* Power efficiency: as small as possible for required data rate and error
  probability
* Error detection/correction
* Suitable power spectral density, e.g., little low frequency content
* Timing information: clock must be extracted from data
* Transparency: all possible binary sequences can be transmitted

# Alternate Mark Inversion (Bipolar) Signaling
AMI encodes 0 as 0 V and 1 as +V or âˆ’V, with alternating signs.
AMI was used in early PCM systems.
* Eliminates DC build up on cable.
* Reduces bandwidth compared to polar.
* Provides error detecting; every bit error results in bipolar violation.
* Guarantees transitions for timing recovery with long runs of ones.
